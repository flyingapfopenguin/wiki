Once we were able to set up a video stream of my desktop with Open Broadcast Studio and the RTMP module of Nginx by following https://opensource.com/article/19/1/basic-live-video-streaming-server.

Note that we needed to set the video encoding to mp4 in Open Broadcast Studio to make the video stream work.
